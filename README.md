# eloquent-haibt

Implement an internal tool for viewing code edit data from a CSV file:

1. Install a CSV parsing library like PapaParse 
2. Add a file input to allow uploading a CSV file
3. When a file is selected, parse the CSV data using the library
4. Filter the parsed data to only include rows where type is "ai_update"
5. Extract the unique project IDs from the filtered data
6. Add a dropdown to select a project ID. Default to the first project ID.
7. When a project ID is selected, filter the data to that project
8. Display the filtered data in a table with these columns:
   - Edit ID
   - Commit SHA
   - GitHub commit link using the format: https://github.com/search?q=commit%3A{COMMIT_SHA}&amp;type=commits
   - Parsed tags.coutput data. Handle parsing errors gracefully.
9. Show a message if no data matches the selected project ID.
10. Add styling to make the tool easy to use and read.
